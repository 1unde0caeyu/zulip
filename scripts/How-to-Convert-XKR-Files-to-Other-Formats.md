# How to Convert XKR Files to Other Formats
 
XKR files are karaoke files that contain lyrics and music data. They are created by Kanto Karaoke, a software that allows you to create and play karaoke songs on your computer. However, XKR files are not widely supported by other karaoke players or devices, so you may want to convert them to other formats, such as MP3, CDG, or KAR.

## Why Convert XKR Files to Other Formats?
 
XKR files are proprietary files that can only be played by Kanto Karaoke. If you want to play your karaoke songs on other devices or platforms, such as your smartphone, tablet, TV, or online, you need to convert them to other formats that are more compatible and widely supported. For example, MP3 files can be played by almost any media player or device, CDG files can be used by most karaoke machines and software, and KAR files can be edited by various karaoke editors.
 
By converting XKR files to other formats, you can also reduce the file size and save storage space on your computer or device. XKR files are usually larger than other karaoke formats because they contain both audio and lyrics data. By converting them to MP3 or CDG files, you can separate the audio and lyrics data and compress them more efficiently.
 
## What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Format?
 
Each format has its own advantages and disadvantages when it comes to karaoke. Here are some of them:

- MP3: This is a common audio format that can be played by almost any device or software. It has good sound quality and small file size. However, it does not contain any lyrics data, so you need to use a separate file or software to display the lyrics.
- CDG: This is a popular karaoke format that contains both audio and lyrics data in a single file. It can be used by most karaoke machines and software. It has decent sound quality and moderate file size. However, it does not support any graphics or animations for the lyrics.
- KAR: This is a MIDI-based karaoke format that contains only lyrics data. It can be edited by various karaoke editors and played by some karaoke software. It has very small file size and supports graphics and animations for the lyrics. However, it does not contain any audio data, so you need to use a separate file or software to play the music.
- MIDI: This is a musical instrument digital interface format that contains only music data. It can be played by some karaoke software and devices. It has very small file size and supports various instruments and effects for the music. However, it does not contain any lyrics or vocals data, so you need to use a separate file or software to display the lyrics and sing along.
- Video: This is a visual format that contains both audio and video data in a single file. It can be played by most media players and devices. It has high sound and video quality and supports graphics and animations for the lyrics. However, it has very large file size and may not be compatible with some karaoke software or machines.
